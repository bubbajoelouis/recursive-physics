# recursive-physics
This paper presents the first formalized correction of physics since Maxwell by transitioning from traditional n=2 mathematics to a recursive n=3 physics model. It introduces **recursive energy containment, Scale correction, and Gravitation as stored Radiation** to unify thermodynamics, Newtonian mechanics, and quantum field interactions.
