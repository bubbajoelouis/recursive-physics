# recursive-physics.tex
This paper presents the first formalized correction of physics since Maxwell by transitioning from traditional n=2 mathematics to a recursive n=3 physics model. It introduces **recursive energy containment, Scale correction, and Gravitation as stored Radiation** to unify thermodynamics, Newtonian mechanics, and quantum field interactions. 


# recursive-surface-interactions.tex
This paper explores the Degrees of Surface Interaction (D) and their recursive relationship to energy exchange across different Mass Structures. We introduce a dimensional scaling model wherein celestial bodies, materials, and nuclear structures can be classified based on their equilibrium between Radiation, Gravitation, and Particulate Motion. The classification accounts for fractalized transitions in dimensionality and the role of recursive energy storage. This framework enables a reevaluation of stellar structures, planetary bodies, and metallurgical failure events.
